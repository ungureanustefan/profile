Hi, my name is Stefan. I am a Psychology graduate but I have changed my path towards Software Development as I've found that I enjoy it more.

For the past 9 months I have learned coding mostly by completing the Full Stack Certificate on FreeCodeCamp and watching YouTube videos.

# About me

I am originally from Romania. I came to the UK to study Psychology, but after I've finished the course I have found programming and I got absorbed in it.

**Other interests include:**

- Psychology (I have kept it as a passion)
- Travel
- Fitness and MMA
- Movies
